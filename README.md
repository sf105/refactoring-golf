# Refactoring Golf
`https://github.com/sf105/refactoring-golf`

_Refactoring Golf_ is a game designed to stretch your refactoring muscles and 
to get you to explore your IDE to see what's really possible using 
shortcuts and automation. The idea is to focus on one aspect of coding 
and see how far it can be pushed.

This repository contains multiple versions of a simple class to calculate tax on a payslip.

* The first 5,000 is tax free
* Up to 20,000 is taxed at 10%
* Up to 40,000 is taxed at 20%
* Above 40,000 is taxed at 40%

Each version is a refactoring of the previous version. Sticking with the golf metaphor, 
each version is called a "hole". 

Your goal is to refactor from each _hole_ to the next safely and efficiently,
using the features of the IDE with as few "strokes" as possible, where a _stroke_ is 
an action that changes the code. Every stroke costs you points.

Your pairing partner should carefully score you as follows:

- 0 points for formatting and selection
- 1 point for every change made to the code using a shortcut or automated IDE feature 
  (e.g., an automated refactoring, code template, rename, or Find/Replace)
- 2 points for every manual edit. Note that a single "edit" could cover multiple lines of code.
- There is a _double points_ penalty for changes that leave the code failing the tests or not compiling.

Allow yourselves a maximum of 2 attempts at each round to determine your best score.

## Hints
- Each version has a `notes.md` file that describes the motivation for the next refactoring.
- You might want to keep the target code open in another window, or perhaps on the partner's machine. 
It's easy to get confused about which file is which.
- Commit your code frequently, especially after each refactoring stage. That will make rolling-back easier 
if you want to make another attempt or if you get confused.
- Run the tests after each "stroke". You can do this by selecting the top-level *refactoring-golf* in 
the project view and selecting `Run 'All Tests'` from the pop-up menu. 
- Check your code in frequently so it's easier to try a refactoring more than once. Idea also has 
an excellent _Local History_ option. 

## Practical
- This exercise was written with _Intellj Idea_. You should be able to clone the repository 
and _Open_ it as a project. 
- Idea has a _Keymap Reference_ available from the help menu. If you're unfamiliar, it's worth reading this through 
and keeping it handy
- Mouse actions are fine to start with, but learn the key shortcuts

## Example scores
These are some example scores, achieved using IntelliJ.  

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Hole</th><th>Best score</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><td> 1    </td><td> 6          </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 2    </td><td> 3          </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 3    </td><td> 9          </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 4    </td><td> 17         </td><td>lots of manual edits</td></tr> 
<tr><td> 5    </td><td> 13         </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 6    </td><td> 14         </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 7    </td><td> 29         </td><td>This one is quite hard, but is possible</td></tr>       
<tr><td> 8    </td><td> 8          </td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td> 9    </td><td> xx         </td><td></td></tr>
</table>       

## Alternative versions
There's an alternative version that was implemented using TDD from scratch in the 
`reimplemented-with-tdd` branch of the repository.

There's also an Italian version in the `italian` branch. 

## Acknowledgements
This exercise was mainly taken from an example by Lance Walton.

Other ideas were taken from David Denton and Ivan Sanchez, inspired by @ivanmoore and @rchatley

These instructions were mostly stolen from @jasongorman's

## Notes

- we used `double` for the calculations. Using floating point types is usually a bad idea for money, 
but here it's to simplify the exercises. The alternative TDD version uses `long`. Both should probably 
use a decimal format.
